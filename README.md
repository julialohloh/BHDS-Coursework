BHDS Cousework Assignment
*Please read the files 
This coursework has 2 sections - coursework 1 as denoted in the CW1 folder and coursework final as denoted in the CWF folder

Coursework 1 involves identifying consensus sequence from a list of DNA sequences requested by user. The calculation of the consensus sequence is based on weight table, which is the percentage of number of occurrences of a DNA base across the DNA sequences input. The corresponding weights of the consensus DNA sequence is summed up to produce 
the base score which then is used to calculate the matching probability of one user input DNA sequence against the conensus sequence. 
This program can then be used to calculate the matching probability of new DNA sequences.

Coursework Final is an extension of coursework 1 where the the weighted table from CW1(Table 1) is used to calculate the weights at all locations of the gene sequences of a
photosynthetic bacteria, “Synechococcus elongatus” (file “gbbct1_truncated.seq.txt”) (from locations 1 through 2988), in blocks of 5 DNAs. Once the sequence weight for all locations are calculated, the sequence weight and the corresponding location(s), for all sequence weights that fall within the threshold of 70% are to be computed. An additional requirement to this coursework is also to modify the codes to consolidate all overlapping regions in the “Synechococcus elongatus” DNA sequence.
